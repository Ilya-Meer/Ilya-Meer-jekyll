    Coming from an ESL teaching background, I know that everyone communicates in their own way. At the same time, the web enables all of us to put our message where it can be seen by the world, which is why well-designed, well-built, intuitive web experiences are so important as more people gain access to the web.

    My interest lies in deploying the flexibility and abundance of the web platform to make clean, responsive sites and UIs that help everyone get where they want to go. I've found the web to be a very welcoming place, and I want to keep it that way.
